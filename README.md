## Project Picks

[Light Node](https://github.com/Quantum158/Light-Node): An Arduino project to interface with the E1.31 (sACN) lighting network protocol. Control LEDs and other lighting fixtures over a wireless connection. Also broadcasts a configuration web portal for pairing and setup.

[Speed Controller](https://github.com/Quantum158/SpeedController): A Python project using Qt which I developed while learning Python and introductory programming skills. Features a timing system to support competitive speed climbers, as well as a network interface to autonomously start and stop GoPro cameras for video analysis.

[CI Tool for Jeyll](https://github.com/Quantum158/Jekyll-PR-Preview): A Node application which listens to new PRs on a repository, hosts the new changes, and deploys them to a preview site.

[Github Action Jekyll CI](https://github.com/epstechtheatre/Jekyll-Tester): A simplified tester for Jekyll that runs in Github Actions allowing repo owners to verify PRs will build when merged

[Wiki for Technical Theatre](https://github.com/epstechtheatre/epstechtheatre.github.io): A learning repository for students entering the world of technical theatre. Created by me and populated by a volunteer group of students and alumnis.
