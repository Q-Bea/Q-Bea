## Project Picks

[Fringe Controller](https://github.com/Q-Bea/Gameshow33Fringe2022): A media projection and management web application created for a show performed at the 2022 Calgary Fringe Festival. Operators could intuitively display and control visuals and sounds split into different "scenes" to compliment actors on-stage.

[Is It Raining](https://github.com/Q-Bea/is-it-raining): A simplistic weather station designed to run on a Raspberry Pi. When activited by a user, the device would audibly respond with answers to three questions: Is it raining? Is it windy? And is it cold?

[Light Node](https://github.com/Q-Bea/Light-Node): An Arduino project to interface with the E1.31 (sACN) lighting network protocol. Control LEDs and other lighting fixtures connected to the Arduino over a wireless connection using lighting data present on the network. Broadcasts a web portal to enable full configurability without the need for reprogramming.

[Wiki for Technical Theatre](https://github.com/epstechtheatre/epstechtheatre.github.io): A learning repository for students entering the world of technical theatre containing guides and tutorial on using various theatre equipment.
